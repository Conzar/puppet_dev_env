[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/Conzar/puppet_dev_env.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/Conzar/puppet_dev_env)

## About

Installs tools and configuration to support a puppet developer.

## Requirements

* Puppet to be installed locally.

## Usage

The basic use case is as below:

```
	class { 'puppet_dev_env' :
  	  user => 'user_name',
	}
```

This sets up VIM configuration for the user specified.
This assumes the user's home directory is /home/<username>.
It also installs the puppet-test script in /usr/local/bin.

If the user has a different home path, than use the following:

```
	class { 'puppet_dev_env' :
  	  user 			=> 'user_name',
  	  user_home_dir => 'path',
	}
```

## Features

Installs the following plugins by default: nerdtree, nerdtreetabs, tabular, 
vim-puppet, numbers.
Also installs puppet-lint.

## Commands
